# Abstract[^1]

Hummel (2020) found that leader deaths rarely result in political liberalization; while personalist and older dictators' deaths are more likely to lead to liberalization, such opportunities are nonetheless modest. With replication data and code provided by Professor Hummel through the Harvard Dataverse, I was able to replicate the findings of the original paper. Given the robustness of the models created in the Appendix of the original paper, I extended the results by adapting the published figures to a multi-color palette which is colorblind-friendly.

# Replication Analysis

I began with a replication of Figure 2 from Hummel (2020). The figure depicts the coefficient estimates from a total of 48 different models which assess the effect of leader age on political change. The models are primarily in four different categories, based on their dependent variables. The first set of models uses Polity; the second set of models uses Democracy; the third set of models uses Regime Change; and the last set of models uses Absolute Polity Change. Within each set of models, there are three sub-categories. Each of these uses three different time effects: 1-Year Dependent Variable, which compares the dependent variable in year *t* to year *t-2*; 5-Year Dependent Variable, which compares the dependent variable in years *t* through *t+4* to year *t-2*; and a 10-Year Dependent Variable, which compares the dependent variable in years *t* through *t+9* to year *t-2*. Furthermore, within each of these subgroups, there are 4 versions of the model: one without a control for leader age and without fixed effects; one with a control for leader age and without fixed effects; one without a control for leader age and with fixed effects; and one with a control for age and with fixed effects. All models using Polity and Absolute Polity Change were linear models, whereas all models using Democracy and Regime Change were logit models. For the fixed effects linear models, fixed effects included country and year. For the fixed effects logit models, conditional logit models with country fixed effects were used.
