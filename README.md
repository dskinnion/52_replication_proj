# GOV 52: Replication Project

My name is Dominic Skinnion, and I am a current Sophomore at Harvard College studying Government and Statistics. If you would like to reach me, my email is dskinnion@college.harvard.edu.

This project was completed for GOV 52: Models, taught by Professor Gill at Harvard University. I have chosen to replicate the paper "Leader Age, Death, and Political Liberalization in Dictatorships" by Professor Sarah Hummel of Harvard University.

I have been interested in authoritarian regimes, and I have had the honor of taking GOV 1249: Authoritarianism with Professor Hummel at Harvard University in the Spring of 2021. 

My sincerest thanks to Professor Hummel for her instruction and for making her code and materials open to the public through the Harvard Dataverse.
